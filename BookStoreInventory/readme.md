Creation, execution and saving commands in decorator class instead of inventory class gives feasibility to provide additional functionality and modify the additional functionality without changing the base code of inventory class. For instance if the commands have to be saved in database instead of file system then this can be achieved by creating a decorator to perform the read, write database operations but if this additional functionality is created in inventory class then for every additional requirement, inventory class has to be updated. Therefore decorator is a better idea.
